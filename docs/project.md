### **E-Commerce Platform**
- **Objective**: Create an e-commerce platform with product catalogs, user reviews, shopping carts, and order management.
- **Features to Cover**:
    - Schema design: Use MongoDB’s flexible schema to handle product data, which may have various attributes.
    - Transactions: Implement multi-document transactions to ensure atomicity for critical operations like placing an order.
    - Text search: Allow users to search for products using MongoDB’s full-text search capabilities.
    - Aggregation pipeline: Calculate total sales, filter products by category, or generate custom reports.
    - Sharding: If your dataset grows large, implement sharding to distribute data across multiple servers.

### **E-Commerce Platform (with Complex Relationships and Aggregations)**
- **Objective**: Expand the e-commerce platform to manage users, orders, reviews, and product recommendations.
- **Complexity**:
    - **Multi-document relations**:
        - Separate collections for users, orders, products, reviews, and categories.
        - **Order history**: Store references to both user and product documents in the orders collection, allowing aggregation to calculate the total value of user purchases or top-selling products.
    - **Aggregation**:
        - Use aggregation pipelines to generate product recommendations based on user buying patterns (e.g., "customers who bought this also bought...").
        - Build complex queries that analyze user reviews and sentiment, categorizing products based on customer satisfaction.
    - **Text search with aggregation**: Implement a search bar where users can search products by name and description, and use aggregation to refine search results based on price, category, or reviews.

### **Inventory Management System**
- **Objective**: Manage inventory for a store, tracking stock levels, restocking, and order fulfillment.
- **Features to Cover**:
    - Transactions: Manage stock levels when items are sold or restocked.
    - Time-series collections: Track stock levels over time.
    - Aggregation: Generate reports on the most sold products, low stock alerts, etc.
    - Indexing: Use indexes for efficient querying when searching for products or categories.
    - Backup and restore: Explore MongoDB’s backup and recovery features.

### **Inventory Management System (with Transactions and Complex Aggregations)**
- **Objective**: Build an advanced system for managing stock levels, including supplier management and sales tracking.
- **Complexity**:
    - **Multi-document relations**:
        - Separate collections for products, suppliers, and orders.
        - Reference suppliers in the products collection and track restock orders by linking products and suppliers.
        - Manage sales transactions across multiple collections (products, orders, customers).
    - **Aggregation**:
        - Calculate inventory status by aggregating stock data and combining it with order fulfillment data.
        - Generate reports on inventory turnover, which products need restocking, and supplier performance.
    - **Transactions**:
        - Use **multi-document transactions** to ensure that when products are sold, stock levels are updated and orders are created in an atomic manner.
        - Handle product returns, which require undoing the stock reduction and updating orders and inventory.
