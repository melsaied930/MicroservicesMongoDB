Here’s a detailed schema design for the **E-Commerce Platform with Interactive Inventory Management System**, using **UUIDs** for each document as the `_id` field, representing MongoDB collections as documents. Below are the detailed models for users, products, orders, inventory, suppliers, etc.

### 1. **User Collection (`users`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "username": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string",  // Should be hashed
  "roles": ["string"],  // E.g., ['customer', 'admin']
  "created_at": "ISODate",
  "updated_at": "ISODate"
}
```

### 2. **User Profile Collection (`user_profiles`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "user_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `users._id`
  "first_name": "string",
  "last_name": "string",
  "address": {
    "street": "string",
    "city": "string",
    "state": "string",
    "postal_code": "string",
    "country": "string"
  },
  "phone_number": "string",
  "shipping_address": {
    "street": "string",
    "city": "string",
    "state": "string",
    "postal_code": "string",
    "country": "string"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Product Collection (`products`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "category_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `categories._id`
  "price": "decimal",  // MongoDB supports decimal128 for precise prices
  "stock": "int",  // Available quantity
  "image_url": "string",  // Image URL or reference to GridFS
  "created_at": "ISODate",
  "updated_at": "ISODate"
}
```

### 4. **Category Collection (`categories`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "name": "string",  // E.g., "Electronics", "Clothing"
  "description": "string"
}
```

### 5. **Shopping Cart Collection (`carts`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "user_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `users._id`
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `products._id`
      "quantity": "int",  // Quantity of this product in the cart
      "price": "decimal"  // Price at the time of adding to cart
    }
  ],
  "total_price": "decimal",  // Computed total price for the cart
  "created_at": "ISODate",
  "updated_at": "ISODate"
}
```

### 6. **Order Collection (`orders`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "user_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `users._id`
  "status": "string",  // E.g., "pending", "shipped", "delivered"
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `products._id`
      "quantity": "int",
      "price": "decimal"  // Price at the time of ordering
    }
  ],
  "total_price": "decimal",  // Computed total price for the order
  "shipping_address": {
    "street": "string",
    "city": "string",
    "state": "string",
    "postal_code": "string",
    "country": "string"
  },
  "created_at": "ISODate",

}
```

### 7. **Order Items Collection (`order_items`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "order_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `orders._id`
  "product_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `products._id`
  "quantity": "int",
  "price": "decimal"  // Price when the order was placed
}
```

### 8. **Inventory Management Collection (`products`)**
In this case, the `products` collection will already hold `stock` values, so the Inventory Management system would:
- Update stock when a sale is made (decrement)
- Update stock when restocking occurs (increment)

```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "name": "string",
  "stock": "int",  // Represents current stock quantity
  "restock_threshold": "int",  // Minimum stock before a restock alert
  "created_at": "ISODate",
  "updated_at": "ISODate"
}
```

### 9. **Restock Orders Collection (`restock_orders`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "product_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `products._id`
  "supplier_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `suppliers._id`
  "quantity": "int",  // Quantity to be restocked
  "status": "string",  // E.g., "pending", "received"
  "restock_date": "ISODate",
  "created_at": "ISODate",
  "updated_at": "ISODate"
}
```

### 10. **Supplier Collection (`suppliers`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "name": "string",
  "contact_person": {
    "name": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "phone_number": "string"
  },
  "address": {
    "street": "string",
    "city": "string",
    "state": "string",
    "postal_code": "string",
    "country": "string"
  },
  "created_at": "ISODate",
  "updated_at": "ISODate"
}
```

### 11. **Review Collection (`reviews`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "product_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `products._id`
  "user_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `users._id`
  "rating": "int",  // Rating from 1 to 5
  "comment": "string",
  "created_at": "ISODate",
  "updated_at": "ISODate"
}
```

### 12. **Sales Reports Collection (`sales_reports`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "date_range": {
    "start_date": "ISODate",
    "end_date": "ISODate"
  },
  "total_sales": "decimal",  // Total sales in the given period
  "best_selling_products": [
    {
      "product_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `products._id`
      "units_sold": "int"
    }
  ],
  "worst_selling_products": [
    {
      "product_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `products._id`
      "units_sold": "int"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 13. **Product Recommendations Collection (`recommendations`)**
```json
{
  "_id": "UUID",  // Auto-generated
  "user_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `users._id`
  "recommended_products": [
    {
      "product_id": "UUID",  // Reference to `products._id`
      "reason": "string"  // E.g., "Based on previous purchases"
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "ISODate",
  "updated_at": "ISODate"
}
```

### Additional Considerations:
1. **Indexes**:
    - **User Collection**: Create indexes on `email` and `username` for faster lookups.
    - **Product Collection**: Index `name`, `category_id`, and `price` for quick search results.
    - **Order Collection**: Index `user_id` and `status` for fast access to user order history.

2. **Transactions**:
    - When placing an order, ensure that both the stock in the `products` collection is updated, and the `orders` and `order_items` documents are created within a single transaction to maintain atomicity.

3. **Aggregation Pipelines**:
    - **Sales reports** can use aggregation pipelines to calculate top-selling products, total revenue, etc.
    - **Inventory management** can use aggregations to track stock and issue low-stock alerts.


Users
|---> Profile (1-to-1)
|---> Orders (1-to-Many)
|---> Cart (1-to-1)

Cart
|---> User (1-to-1)
|---> Products (Many-to-Many)

Products
|---> Category (Many-to-1)
|---> Orders (Many-to-Many)
|---> Suppliers (Many-to-Many)
|---> RestockOrders (1-to-Many)

Orders
|---> Products (Many-to-Many with quantities)
|---> User (Many-to-1)
|---> Shipping Address (can link with Address collection)

Suppliers
|---> Products (Many-to-Many)

RestockOrders
|---> Product (Many-to-1)
|---> Supplier (Many-to-1)

SalesReports
|---> Products (Many-to-Many)


To extract and understand the schema relationships among your MongoDB collections (carts, suppliers, products, users, categories, orders, salesReports, restockOrders, and profiles), you can follow these steps to map out the relationships and dependencies between the collections.

### Step 1: Identify Key Relationships

Start by identifying how the collections are related to one another based on your data models:

1. **Users & Profiles**:
   - **User to Profile**: One-to-One relationship.
      - Each `User` can have one `Profile`.
      - In `User`: `UUID profileId` refers to the `Profile`.

2. **Users & Carts**:
   - **User to Cart**: One-to-One relationship.
      - Each `User` can have one `Cart`.
      - In `Cart`: `UUID userId` refers to the `User`.

3. **Products & Categories**:
   - **Product to Category**: Many-to-One relationship.
      - Each `Product` belongs to a `Category`.
      - In `Product`: `UUID categoryId` refers to the `Category`.

4. **Orders & Users**:
   - **User to Orders**: One-to-Many relationship.
      - Each `User` can place multiple `Orders`.
      - In `Order`: `UUID userId` refers to the `User`.

5. **Orders & Products**:
   - **Order to Products**: Many-to-Many relationship (with quantities).
      - Each `Order` can contain multiple `Products`, and each `Product` can belong to multiple `Orders`.
      - In `Order`: A list of `OrderItem` that references `Product`.

6. **Suppliers & Products**:
   - **Supplier to Product**: Many-to-Many relationship.
      - Products can be supplied by multiple suppliers, and a supplier can supply multiple products.
      - In `Product` or `RestockOrder`, you might reference `supplierId`.

7. **Restock Orders & Products**:
   - **RestockOrder to Product**: Many-to-One relationship.
      - Each `RestockOrder` contains details of the restocked `Product`.
      - In `RestockOrder`: `UUID productId` refers to the `Product`.

8. **SalesReports**:
   - **SalesReport to Products**: Many-to-Many relationship.
      - Each `SalesReport` refers to multiple `Products` for reporting best/worst selling.
      - In `SalesReport`: Lists of `BestSellingProduct` and `WorstSellingProduct`, each referencing `productId`.

### Step 2: Visualize Relationships

To visualize these relationships, you can draw an **ER diagram** (Entity-Relationship diagram) or a **schema diagram**. Here’s a textual representation of how collections are related:

```
Users
  |---> Profile (1-to-1)
  |---> Orders (1-to-Many)
  |---> Cart (1-to-1)

Cart
  |---> User (1-to-1)
  |---> Products (Many-to-Many)

Products
  |---> Category (Many-to-1)
  |---> Orders (Many-to-Many)
  |---> Suppliers (Many-to-Many)
  |---> RestockOrders (1-to-Many)

Orders
  |---> Products (Many-to-Many with quantities)
  |---> User (Many-to-1)
  |---> Shipping Address (can link with Address collection)

Suppliers
  |---> Products (Many-to-Many)

RestockOrders
  |---> Product (Many-to-1)
  |---> Supplier (Many-to-1)

SalesReports
  |---> Products (Many-to-Many)
```

### Step 3: Using MongoDB Schema Design Tools

You can also use tools to extract schema relationships automatically from your MongoDB database:

1. **MongoDB Compass**:
   - **MongoDB Compass** has a schema analysis feature that allows you to explore your collections and view the data structure and types. This won't show relationships explicitly but gives you insight into the collections' schemas and field types.

2. **Mongoose Virtuals/References** (for reference in code):
   - If you were using something like **Mongoose** in Node.js, you could set up virtuals or populate references to link collections. Though Spring Data MongoDB doesn’t have virtuals, you manually handle relationships via the code (service layer).

3. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Tools**:
   - **draw.io**, **Lucidchart**, or **DbSchema** are tools that you can use to visually draw and maintain your schema diagram.
   - You can manually create the relationships and visualize your collections, making it easier to see how they are connected.

### Step 4: Manually Document the Relationships

Based on the relationships described, you can manually document or build a visual schema diagram to depict the connections between collections.

Would you like assistance in generating a **graphical schema** or specific queries to traverse these relationships within MongoDB?
